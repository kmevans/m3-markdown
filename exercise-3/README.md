# mkdir

mkdir is a very useful command because it allows you to make directories.

In order to use it, just type `mkdir` followed by the name of the directory you want to make.

Reasons mkdir is awesome:

1. You can make new directories.
 - Do you actually need more reasons than that?
 - Seriously?
 - Alright, here's one more.
2. Its name is short so you don't have to type "make directory". So many letters saved!
